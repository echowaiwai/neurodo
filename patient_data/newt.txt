Yesterday was such a good day for me until...

I decided I need to get some groceries last night and headed out to my local WalMart. While I was picking out some oranges I noticed that some of them had some strange lumps just under the skin. I started thinking about those radio transmitters that they are putting in cargo now to track shipments and began to wonder if that was what those were.

Now I know that stores like WalMart have cameras and everything and that they follow your every move once you are in their parking lot but I just couldn't help myself. I pulled out my pocket knife and started cutting open every orange that had a strange bump. I managed to cut open about a dozen or so before a produce guy confronted me.

From there it just escalated... I told him what I was doing, he called me crazy, we started yelling and everyone was looking at me. Then the manage came over as well as the store security guy. At that point I realized that this was going nowhere fast so I had to pull out the little letter I carry from my doctor hoping that I could just get out of there before the authorities were called.

After agreeing to pay for all the oranges I had cut open (I also bought about 12 more that had the bumps so I could cut them open in the parking lot... no transmitters were found) and to leave immediately I left and went home.
