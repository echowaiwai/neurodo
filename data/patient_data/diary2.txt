Today Ladies and Worms I just saw a wonderful movie, brilliantly titled - Alien Vs. Predator. So you have Drama, Action, Adventure, Sex (including a Sharon Stone leg crossing scene brilliantly executed by the alien!) and all that Jazz. So the movie's got the cute n cuddly aliens poking at the bob marley lookalikes called Predators.

The movie has inspired me like no other...and can match upto any spiritual book ever written. It has the depth of human emotions captured that makes the heart melt.

Synopsis (As the names of the characters cannot be pronounced by the foul human toungue, they have been identified by their species) :

Once upon a time there lived two best friends Alien and Predator. When they were children Predator once borrowed a red crayon from Alien. After a few days Predator instead of giving back the red crayon gave the black crayon (this is because predator guys can only see infra red,ultra violet, s ray n all that crap). At this Alien got angry and complained his equally cute n cuddly parents about it.
Since then the war began.
(NOTE : In case you are curious about the really real story of the movie neither me nor the director of the movie can help ya - neither of us know it.)

So you see the Bob Marley lookin Predators slashing the Aliens(who by the way have an unlimited supply of saliva which can solve some severe drought problems...) and the 'Maggi Noodles'(TM) comin' out of their intestines - Really helps in building an apetite. As the movie further progresses the facial expression get more deep and meaningful like a William Wordsworth sonnet.

Rating - G. Yes watch it with your family, much better than Peter pan.

And as we approach the end we see a hint of a sequel. And everybody knows, that everybody whos anybody is waiting.
