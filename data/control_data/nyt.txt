When I was growing up, crossword puzzles were — along with watching Ken Burns movies and eating lox — among the unfathomable pleasures of grown-ups. My grandmother would sit in her den for hours, the puzzle in her lap, looking blankly around the room as if she had just read a piece of news whose enormity she could scarcely comprehend. Other adults would periodically drift by to offer their condolences (“A nine-letter religious figure, hmm…”) and I would stare from the rug in disbelieving boredom.

My conversion to a crossword puzzler, then — and not just any puzzler, but one who has favorite puzzle makers, and who occasionally snorts audibly at especially clever clues — has required a bit of an inner adjustment. To my 10-year-old self I can say only: Forgive me. And perhaps more defensibly: Crossword puzzles turn out to be great practice for one of the few endeavors that both of us can respect — fiction writing.

I say this not because of puzzles’ supposed mind-sharpening powers or their vocabulary-building benefits (there are whole reams of words — METE, TYRO, EWER — that I have never used anywhere but in a crossword puzzle). For me the value in puzzling lies deeper than that. A crossword may seem meaningless, but to the hapless writer it can provide a crucial map of the strange terrain of his chosen profession. The crossword-puzzling fiction writer may struggle (in fact, he will certainly struggle), but he will not despair.
