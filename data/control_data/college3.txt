The end of winter marks not only the happier spirits of other students and myself, but also the beginning of spring sports season. In this post, I hope to convey my experience as a division III tennis player and in the my next post, I will elaborate on athletic culture at Amherst.

What are the academic and athletic expectations of student athletes?

My coach put it best when she said, “At a Division III school, academics are number one and athletics are number two whereas at a Division I school, academics and athletics share the number one spot.” Because of the prioritization of academic experience over athletic experience, academics are never compromised for sports. This is evident in my coach’s desire to schedule practices around my class schedule rather than the other way around. For instance, on Wednesdays, I have a class that ends at 4:30 even though practices begin at 4:00. As a result, my coach often schedules a practice for me in the morning instead, so I do not have to miss class or be late for practice.

How demanding is it to keep up with work while also being in season?

Even in the off-season, it can be difficult to balance schoolwork with activities and self-care. However, during season when faced with practices during the week and tournaments on weekend, one needs to manage time extremely effectively. Oddly enough, I find that I am a better student when I am in season compared to when I am not because I have to be focused and make sure I am sleeping enough. During the season, I find that I do not have to compromise my involvement in other clubs, but rather I just have to cut back the time I spend procrastinating.
